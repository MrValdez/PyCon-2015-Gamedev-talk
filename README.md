#PyCon 2015
http://pycon.python.ph

This is the source code for the 'Develping a Platform Game in one hour using Python' talk.

Since the presentation was cut short (we were behind by 20 minutes), I left a lot of comments
and commit messages to help you understand the code. I highly recommend you checkout the
first commit, understand the changes (git diff), and move forward each commit.

I won't be accepting pull requests as this is tutorial/presentation material. 

But feel free to clone, fork, and make changes. I am looking forward to seeing your version.


Suggestions:
1. There is a Snake Charmer image in here. Add that as a character.
2. Add a game feature
3. Fix the bugs
